### Quick Revision Study Reference: SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

---

#### **Overview of SQL Injection**
- **Definition**: SQL Injection (SQLi) occurs when an attacker manipulates a query in a database by injecting malicious SQL code through an input field. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or even full control of the database.

#### **Types of SQL Injection Vulnerabilities**
1. **In-Band SQLi (Classic)**
   - **Definition**: The attacker uses the same communication channel to both inject the SQL code and retrieve results. This is the most common form of SQL injection.
   - **Example**: A simple example is entering `'; DROP TABLE users;--` into a login field, which can delete the entire users table if not properly sanitized.

2. **Blind SQLi**
   - **Definition**: The attacker does not directly see the results of the injection. Instead, they infer information from the behavior of the application (e.g., true/false responses).
   - **Example**: An attacker might inject payloads to determine if a condition is true or false, like `' OR 1=1--` to bypass authentication.

3. **Out-of-Band SQLi**
   - **Definition**: The attacker uses a different communication channel to retrieve data. This technique is often used when the attacker cannot retrieve data through the same channel as the injection.
   - **Example**: Injecting a SQL command that triggers an HTTP request to a remote server controlled by the attacker.

4. **Time-Based Blind SQLi**
   - **Definition**: A type of blind SQLi where the attacker uses time delays to infer whether a query is true or false.
   - **Example**: Using a payload like `' OR IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 0)--` to cause a delay if the condition is true, indicating success.

#### **Prevention Methods**
1. **Use Prepared Statements and Parameterized Queries**
   - **Description**: Prepared statements ensure that SQL queries are compiled with placeholders, separating SQL code from data.
   - **Example**: Using `?` placeholders in a query instead of directly inserting user inputs, e.g., `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?`.

2. **Input Validation and Sanitization**
   - **Description**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to ensure they conform to expected formats and do not contain malicious content.
   - **Best Practice**: Use input validation libraries and frameworks that automatically handle escaping and input validation.

3. **Use of ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**
   - **Description**: ORMs abstract the database interactions, making it harder to inject SQL code.
   - **Example**: Frameworks like Hibernate (Java) and Entity Framework (C#) manage database queries securely.

4. **Least Privilege Principle**
   - **Description**: Ensure the database user executing queries has minimal privileges, preventing attackers from executing destructive queries.
   - **Example**: Use a read-only user for executing SELECT statements, rather than a user with full administrative rights.

5. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - **Description**: Ensure the application does not leak sensitive information through error messages and logs.
   - **Best Practice**: Customize error messages to avoid revealing database structure or query details to users.

#### **Tools Used to Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities**
1. **SQLMap**
   - **Description**: An open-source penetration testing tool that automates the detection and exploitation of SQL injection flaws.
   - **Usage**: SQLMap can be used to enumerate databases, extract data, and even gain shell access to vulnerable servers.
